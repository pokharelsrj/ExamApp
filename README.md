# ExamApp
-Created using MERN Stack. Used antd for UI but it isn't pretty as of now.
-Exam App allows teachers to create and post tests and the students to take the same. Results are displayed on both teacher and student dashboards.
-It is fully authenticated but there's a small problem: While reloading any page after authentication, it redirects the user to the dashboard page. Any help in that regard would be appreciated.
-Please feel free to contribute.
